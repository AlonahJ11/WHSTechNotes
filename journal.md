A app that would be helpful to the schools community, would be an app where you can type in what you are learning in class and it gives you a note layout to copy and study. In my opinion this will be helpful because, some people dont actully know how to write notes by themselves or they dont know how to study. Students, after a while, will learn what type of stuff to put on notes and how to start.

Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for furture jobs. For example, IKEA is experimenting with a roblox store where people can earn $16.10 an hour by doing tasks like restocking shelves and helping customers. This shows that real companies see value in virtual work. This is a good idea because it creates new job opportunities for people who may not work in a physical store, such as students, people with disabilites , or those living far from cities. it also combines technology, gaming, and work in a way that makes jobs more accessible and flexible.
