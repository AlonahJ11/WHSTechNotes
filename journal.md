A app that would be helpful to the schools community, would be an app where you can type in what you are learning in class and it gives you a note layout to copy and study. In my opinion this will be helpful because, some people dont actully know how to write notes by themselves or they dont know how to study. Students, after a while, will learn what type of stuff to put on notes and how to start.

Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for furture jobs. For example, IKEA is experimenting with a roblox store where people can earn $16.10 an hour by doing tasks like restocking shelves and helping customers. This shows that real companies see value in virtual work. This is a good idea because it creates new job opportunities for people who may not work in a physical store, such as students, people with disabilites , or those living far from cities. it also combines technology, gaming, and work in a way that makes jobs more accessible and flexible.

Students often shout "6 7" as if it carries a secret meaning. I think it works like an inside joke that spreads quickly in the halls. The phrase doesn't need a clear definition, because its power comes from repetition. When people say it, the tone is playful and light. it feels like a code only friends understand.  Students repeat it because it creates connection between your peers.

If i were in charge of school, games like "cool math" wouldnt be blocked because, cool math actully had some educational games. Having games unblocked students wouldnt want to be on their phone as much because they will have something to do on their computer. AI tools , like ChatGPT, would be allowed for learning support, such as brainstorming, tutoring, or research, but not for cheating or completing assignments automatically. Teachers would show students how to use AI responsibly so it becomes a tool for learning , not a shortcut. This policy would help students focus, stay creative, and learn how to use technology wisely.

My prompt was designed to help students study better for chemistry. Part of it could have been better, unfortunely it wasnt loading. But the rest of it was good.
