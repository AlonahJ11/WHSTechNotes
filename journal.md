A app that would be helpful to the schools community, would be an app where you can type in what you are learning in class and it gives you a note layout to copy and study. In my opinion this will be helpful because, some people dont actully know how to write notes by themselves or they dont know how to study. Students, after a while, will learn what type of stuff to put on notes and how to start.

Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!
