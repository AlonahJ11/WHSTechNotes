A app that would be helpful to the schools community, would be an app where you can type in what you are learning in class and it gives you a note layout to copy and study. In my opinion this will be helpful because, some people dont actully know how to write notes by themselves or they dont know how to study. Students, after a while, will learn what type of stuff to put on notes and how to start.

Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

I think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea for furture jobs. For example, IKEA is experimenting with a roblox store where people can earn $16.10 an hour by doing tasks like restocking shelves and helping customers. This shows that real companies see value in virtual work. This is a good idea because it creates new job opportunities for people who may not work in a physical store, such as students, people with disabilites , or those living far from cities. it also combines technology, gaming, and work in a way that makes jobs more accessible and flexible.

Students often shout "6 7" as if it carries a secret meaning. I think it works like an inside joke that spreads quickly in the halls. The phrase doesn't need a clear definition, because its power comes from repetition. When people say it, the tone is playful and light. it feels like a code only friends understand.  Students repeat it because it creates connection between your peers.

If i were in charge of school, games like "cool math" wouldnt be blocked because, cool math actully had some educational games. Having games unblocked students wouldnt want to be on their phone as much because they will have something to do on their computer. AI tools , like ChatGPT, would be allowed for learning support, such as brainstorming, tutoring, or research, but not for cheating or completing assignments automatically. Teachers would show students how to use AI responsibly so it becomes a tool for learning , not a shortcut. This policy would help students focus, stay creative, and learn how to use technology wisely.

My prompt was designed to help students study better for chemistry. Part of it could have been better, unfortunely it wasnt loading. But the rest of it was good.

The problem is that the SNAP program ran out of money , and many families need it to buy food. If it's gone, people might not be able to afford healthy meals. Technology could help by making apps or websites that show where food banks or free meal places are. it could also send alerts when free food is avaliable nearby. Some problems are that not everyone has internet, a phone, or knows how to use apps. If I were the designer, I would make an app called "FoodHelp" that shows people where thay can get free food or cheap food. This could help families find what they need faster.

Technology has changed the way people celebrate and connect during the holidays by making it easier to stay in touch and share memeroies. For example, people can video chat with family members who live far away, share holiday photos on social media , and even send digital gifts through apps. smart devices also help with things like playing holiday music or controlling lights and decorations. These tools make it possible for families to feel close even when they cant be together in person. However, too much screen time can take attention away real life moments.

A self-driving car might miss a stopped school bus if its sensors misread the flashing lights or stop sign. The AI can also get confused in bright light, bad weather, or unusual angles. If I were on the waymo team, i'd add stricter rules that make the car always stop when a bus is detected. I'd also improve the sensors and add an emergency-stop rule to prevent mistakes and keep students safe.

One way technology can help create fairness is by giving everyone equal access to information online. For example, student can use school websites, learning apps, and free videos to study even if they dont have tutors or extra help at home. This helps because all students get the same chance to learn and improve, no matter what.

Professional behavior in shared spaces is important because it helps everyone feel comfortable and focused. Good personal hygiene prevents the spread of germs and keeps the environment pleasant. Loud talking or distracting behavior can make it hard for others to concentrate. People should use respectful language and keep their voices at an appropriate level. Being aware of your surroundings shows respect for others. One habit i can improve is controlling my volume when i talk in shared spaces.
